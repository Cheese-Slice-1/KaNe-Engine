samples in flac

use:
- github.com/eaburns/flac

testing stitch:
- get streams
- decode samples
- merge them
- encode them
- write encoded audio to output.flac

stitch would take an array of already decoded samples

KaNe's default dir is:
- "~/.kane/" in linux and (if i ever do it) macOS (so "/home/your-username")
- "C:\users\your-username\.kane\" in windows (if i don't leave it unsuported out of spite heheheh)
