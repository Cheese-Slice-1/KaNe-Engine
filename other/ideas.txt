samples in flac

LINUX FIRST!! SHITDOWS LATER!!! (sorry windows people, y'all aren't like the company dw)

i wanna know if making it in more than one PL is a good idea
maybe i can benefit from another PL's functionality for one of the engine parts?
like having it in executable form and bundling it w the app???? idk
how and why people do the 4000 PL thing???? someone teach me plz ;;

use:
- github.com/eaburns/flac

testing stitch:
- get streams
- decode samples
- merge them
- encode them
- write encoded audio to output.flac

stitch would take an array of already decoded samples
if i'm feeling lazy i'll let the other version (w files) live too

KaNe's default dir is:
- "~/.local/share/kane/" in linux and (if i ever do it) macOS (so "/home/your-username")
    * therefor singers dir is "~/.local/share/kane/singers", ez
- "C:\users\your-username\kane\" in windows (if i don't leave it unsuported out of spite heheheh)
    * souu "C:\users\your-username\kane\singers" is the (you guessed it) singers dir

why did i kinda copypaste that...? idk
